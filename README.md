How would it work?

The Monte Carlo test works by simulating a large number of scenarios where the car's auto-pilot system processes random inputs, such as desired steering angles, and calculates the actual output.

What happens if there is input whose output error is larger than the maximum permissible error?

The error for each scenario is measured as the absolute difference between the desired and actual steering. If there is an input whose output error exceeds the maximum permissible threshold, it suggests the system may fail to operate safely under such conditions, and improvements in its design or error handling may be necessary.

What happens if there is no input whose output error is larger than the maximum permissible error?

If no input produces an error larger than the threshold, it indicates the system is reliable within the tested conditions, though further testing for extreme or edge cases might still be needed.

How can the RMSE of the system be calculated?

The RMSE is calculated by squaring all the errors, averaging them, and then taking the square root, providing a single metric that summarizes the systemâ€™s average error performance.
