How would it work?

The Monte Carlo test for an autonomous vehicle's auto-pilot system involves simulating numerous scenarios where random steering inputs are processed, calculating the actual output, and measuring the error as the absolute difference between desired and actual steering.

What happens if there is input whose output error is larger than the maximum permissible error?

If an input results in an error exceeding the maximum permissible error, it highlights a potential failure point, suggesting that the system's design or error handling needs improvement to ensure safe operation under those conditions.

What happens if there is no input whose output error is larger than the maximum permissible error?

If no input yields an error beyond the acceptable threshold, it indicates the system's reliability within the tested scenarios, although further testing for extreme conditions would be prudent.

How can the RMSE of the system be calculated?

The RMSE of the system can be determined by squaring each error, averaging these squares, and taking the square root of this average, providing a single metric to assess the system's typical error performance.
